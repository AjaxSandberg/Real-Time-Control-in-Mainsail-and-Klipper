# Real-Time-Control-in-Mainsail-and-Klipper
A real time control script and grasshopper plugin for mainsail and klipper.

Welcome! 

This is a grasshopper plugin I developed that allows you to talk to mainsail and klipper in real time. 

Firstly, please install the plugin. 

To use it, run the bridge.py script and connect to it in grasshopper. check the connection and send Gcode lines to mainsail and klipper usin the send component. You can also navigate to a locally hosted web socket that will
show how many commands are left, how many are done... and so on.
